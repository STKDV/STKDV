In this Github link, we show how we display STKDV as a time-evolving hotspot map in the New York traffic accident dataset, which contains nearly 1.3 million data points. Here, we adopt the 128x128x128 space-time cube for generating STKDV.

The first figure shows the time-evolving hotspot map in New York (from 2012 to 2019).

The second figure shows the time-evolving hotspot map in Upper Manhattan (from 2015 to 2019).
