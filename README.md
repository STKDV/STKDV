This is the code for our paper "SWS: An Efficient Sliding-Window-based Solution for Spatial Temporal Kernel Density Visualization", which is currently under submission to SIGKDD2021.

Due to space limitations in the Github page, we do not upload the datasets in the Github. All the datasets that we have used in this paper are the open data from the governments of different cities, which can be obtained from Ref. [2] (Atlanta), Ref. [7] (Seattle), Ref. [4] (Los Angeles) and Ref. [5] (New York).
