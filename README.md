In this Github link, we show how we display STKDV as a time-evolving hotspot map in the New York traffic accident dataset, which contains nearly 1.3 million data points. Here, we adopt the 128x128x128 space-time cube for generating STKDV.

The first figure shows the time-evolving hotspot map in New York (from 2012 to 2019).

We further zoom in to Upper Manhattan and generate STKDV again (with size 128x128x128). Here, we specify the time range in the space-time cube from 2015 to 2019. The second figure shows the time-evolving hotspot map in this region.

In these two figures, we can observe that the hotspots can change in different timestamps, which can be discovered by the STKDV tool.
